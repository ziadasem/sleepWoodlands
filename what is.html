           <span class="soy"> Sleep apnea</span>  is a condition in which breathing is repeatedly interrupted during sleep. This occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat fail to keep the airway open. The body response to the lack of oxygen is to wake, usually without the person’s awareness, to allow the muscles in the throat to contract and open the passageway.  According to the National Sleep Foundation, chronic snoring is a strong indicator of sleep apnea and should be evaluated by a health professional.

Since people with sleep apnea tend to be sleep deprived, they may suffer from a wide range of other symptoms such as: difficulty concentrating, depression, anxiety, irritability, sexual dysfunction, and low testosterone, along with learning and memory difficulties. If left untreated, sleep apnea can cause insulin resistance, high blood pressure, heart attack, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or stroke.

While overweight patients are at a greater risk for developing sleep apnea, this condition may also be caused by enlarged tonsils, posterior displaced jaws, or masses in the throat.

                        RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome), also known as Willis-Ekbom Disease, is a neurologic sensorimotor disorder that is characterized by an overwhelming urge to move the legs when they are at rest. The urge to move the legs is usually, but not always, accompanied by unpleasant sensations.

These five essential features must be present for a diagnosis of restless legs syndrome:

You have a strong urge to move your legs (sometimes arms and trunk), usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs.

Your symptoms begin or become worse when you are resting or inactive, such as when lying down or sitting.

Your symptoms get better when you move, such as when you walk or stretch, at least as long as the activity continues.

Your symptoms are worse in the evening or night than during the day, or only occur in the evening or nighttime hours.

Your symptoms are not solely accounted for by another condition such as leg cramps, positional discomfort, leg swelling or arthritis. WED/RLS often causes difficulty in falling or staying asleep, one of the chief complaints of the syndrome. Many people who have the disease also have periodic limb movements (PLMs)—jerking of the arms or legs that is often associated with sleep disruption.

                        PLMS (Periodic Leg Movement during Sleep)  consists of involuntary movements of the legs, while asleep. People who suffer from PLMS can be unaware of their limb movements, as they do not always wake from them. PLMS is related to PLMD or Periodic Leg Movement Disorder. These movements happen during the night, at regular intervals before one enters REM sleep. Sufferers often complain of the inability to fall asleep or to remain asleep in association with PLMS. Men and women are equally affected by PLMS; children may develop it as well.<br><br>
                        Some of the signs of PLMS include:<br><br>
                    <i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i> Fatigue or daytime sleepiness<br>

                    <i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i> Chronic disruption of sleep can lead to daytime sleepiness, irritability or general changes in mood.<br>

                    <i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i> The symptomatic limb movements will usually persist over a certain interval, lasting from a few minutes up to several hours.<br>
                    <i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i> Within these events, the leg movements will occur about 5 – 90 seconds apart and last from .5 seconds to 10 second<br>
                    <i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i> Burning, tingling sensations or general discomfort in their legs when they lay down to rest<br>
                    <i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i> Not everyone who has PLMS has RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome); however, about 80% of people who suffer from RLS also suffer from PLMS. <br><br><br><br>
                        Often ones bed partner will be more aware of the movements than the sufferer is. Many times when one suffers from PLMS, they may not fully awaken from the movements, although it does disrupt their sleep. Additionally, one may find they frequently wake up just as they are falling asleep and not know what woke them, as the leg movements usually last only a few seconds.
